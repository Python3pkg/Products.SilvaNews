SilvaNews changes

  Not yet released

    Bugs fixed
 
      - Silva News really depends on Silva Document, not just Silva core.

  0.9

    Features

      - RSS 1.0 overviews on NewsViewers and Aggregators.
        By adding /rss to the URL of a NewsViews, one will
        get the RSS 1.0 feed for this viewer or aggregator.

      - Removed the RSSViewer (replaced by the RSSAggregator).

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed just about all Silva 0.9.3 conversion issues.

    Note: SilvaNews 0.9 is incompatible with previously released
    versions.
