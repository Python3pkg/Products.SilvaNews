SilvaNews changes

  1.1
   
    Features added

      - Added an object that allows viewing news items inside Silva Documents,
        called the Inline News Viewer (thanks to Marc Petitmermet for code 
        and ideas!).

  1.1

    Bugs fixed

      - Changed the names of indexes so they're less likely to clash with 
        names of user-generated objects - SEE UPGRADE.txt!

  1.0

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed 'select all' in edit tabs.

      - Fixed some small template issues so it works correctly with Silva 1.0.

      - Problem in some DateTime argument formatting solved that made viewing 
        certain objects result in an IOError when Silva was running on Windows
        Zope installations.

  0.9.1

    Bugs fixed
 
      - Silva News really depends on Silva Document, not just Silva core.

  0.9

    Features

      - RSS 1.0 overviews on NewsViewers and Aggregators.
        By adding /rss to the URL of a NewsViews, one will
        get the RSS 1.0 feed for this viewer or aggregator.

      - Removed the RSSViewer (replaced by the RSSAggregator).

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed just about all Silva 0.9.3 conversion issues.

    Note: SilvaNews 0.9 is incompatible with previously released
    versions.
