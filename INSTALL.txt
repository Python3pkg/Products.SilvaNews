Installing Silva News

  This package requires Silva 0.9

  Unpack the SilvaNews.tar.gz package into the Products directory of your Zope 
  installation and restart Zope. Go to the Silva root and click on the 
  'service_extensions' object. Scroll to the SilvaNews entry and click 
  'Install'. The product should now be installed correctly.

  Note: for SilvaNews to work correctly, a script needs to be registered to 
  cron so it calls a URL in a certain interval that will search Silva for 
  versions of which the publication status should be updated, and updates that 
  status. This makes that objects that don't get called directly (only using
  the catalog, like News does) get their publication status updated, which 
  would usually happen by calling them through the web (viewing).
  A helper script to call a URL from cron can be found in the 'utils' 
  directory of the Silva core package.
