Installing Silva News

  This package requires Silva 0.9.3

  Unpack the SilvaNews.tar.gz package into the Products directory of
  your Zope installation and restart Zope. Go to the Silva root and
  click on the 'service_extensions' object. Scroll to the SilvaNews
  entry and click 'Install'. The product should now be installed
  correctly.

  Note: for SilvaNews to work correctly, a script needs to be
  registered to cron so it calls a URL in a certain interval that will
  search Silva for versions of which the publication status should be
  updated, and updates that status. This makes that objects that don't
  get called directly (only using the catalog, like News does) get
  their publication status updated, which would usually happen by
  calling them through the web (viewing). A helper script to call a
  URL from cron can be found in the 'utils' directory of the Silva
  core package.
