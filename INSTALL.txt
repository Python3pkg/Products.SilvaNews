Installing Silva News

 This package requires Silva 0.8.x (tested with 0.8.4 and 0.8.5)

 Unpack SilvaNews.tar.gz into your Products-directory. Import silva_news_installer.zexp into
 Zope. Now go to the 'test'-tab of /silva_news_installer/install (in the ZMI) and enter the id
 of your Silva root (usually silva). The product will install itself.

 During the installation process a copy of all objects that are overwritten will be placed
 in /silva_news_installer/backup. The installer might unregister some of Silva's icons,
 which can be fixed by manually merging /silva_news_installer/backup/edit/render_icon with
 <silva_root>/service_view_registry/edit/render_icon.
