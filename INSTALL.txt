Installing Silva News

  This package requires Silva 0.9.3.

  Unpack the SilvaNews-0.9.tgz package into the Products directory of
  your Zope installation and restart Zope. Go to the Silva root and
  click on the 'service_extensions' object. Scroll to the SilvaNews
  entry and click 'Install'. The product should now be installed
  correctly.

  Note: for SilvaNews to work correctly for news items to be published
  or expired in the future, a script needs to be registered to cron or
  some other scheduler so it calls the 'status_update' URL at a
  regular interval. 'status_update' will search Silva for versions of
  which the publication status should be updated, and updates that
  status.

  This makes that objects that don't get called directly (only using
  the catalog, like News does) get their publication status updated,
  which would usually happen by calling them through the web
  (viewing).

  This URL can be constructed from the URL to your Silva root with
  the name '/status_update' appended.

  A helper script to call a URL called 'call_url.py' can be found in
  the 'utils' directory of the Silva core package.
