Phase 1:
Implement enhancements and bugfixes to base SilvaNews, including
[x] refactoring code, merging common functions shared between 
    news and agenda
[x] bugfixes, like using earliest and latest times in queries
[x] using three queries in agenda filters, not two
[x] adding metadata fields to the catalog
[x] discuss a computedIntro function, storing the intro in the
    catalog
    A) adjusting searches / sorts using metadata fields
    -- FINAL: adjusted brainsorter...anywhere else?
    --- Uh Oh! Need to call getObject for rendering because:
        a) call to obj.get_thumbnail(classname)
        b) call to display_time
        could add display_time as metadata, but
        not possible for get_thumbnail...
[x] What about using the @@rss.xml view?

[ ] Merge changes to Silva's kupu before sending email to silva-dev.
    -- also check the two kupustyles.css.dtml, so ensure they are the same (?)

Phase 2: 
Add Bethel functionality to base SilvaNews which extends base product
[ ] extra properties to items, link method, external, teaser
    [ ] perhaps use a tinymce popup window to edit teaser
    [ ] replace basic computeIntro with bethels special one
    [ ] adjust viewers to use these functions
    [ ] adding these as metadata fields to the catalog
[ ] add image asset tags
