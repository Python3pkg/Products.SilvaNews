SilvaNews TODO

  0.8
	
	- Icons:

	    Since Silva 0.8.6, there has been a major change in the Silva core
	    that makes it impossible for other products to access certain 
	    folders in the ZODB. One of these folders is the 'globals' folder
	    in the Silva root, where the icons reside. For now, this means that
	    no icons will be shown for SilvaNews objects in the ZMI and the
	    SMI. This will be fixed in a future release

	- RSS versions

	    RSSViewer should be able to handle RSS versions 0.92 and 2.0 as well

	- Viewers

	    A couple of viewers should be added, for instance in-line viewers
	    to be used in documents

        - Scalability

            There are a few issues with scalability, which should be solved in 
            the future. One of them is the issue with many newssources and
            subnewssources: they will all end up in the lists of addable 
            newssources in filters, which doesn't scale at all.
